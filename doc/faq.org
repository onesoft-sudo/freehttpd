* Why freehttpd when other HTTP servers exist?

Good question.  There wasn't any specific reason why I built it.   It was a
random day, and I decided that I'll be writing a HTTP server.  And I did it.  I
didn't build freehttpd to compete with existing HTTP servers, but rather I
created it as a fun project that I can work on to keep myself busy.  If you like
it, thank you and if you wish to contribute, you're welcome!

* Do you plan to support operating systems other than GNU/Linux?

Yes, I eventually plan to support other Unix-like systems.  However, I do not
plan to support Windows, as Windows has completely different APIs compared to
Unix-like systems, therefore it will require a lot of work to support.
Currently freehttpd only supports GNU/Linux, but I very soon will start working
on BSD support.
