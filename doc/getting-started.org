#+title: Getting started with freehttpd
#+include: ./common-config.org

* Introduction

Welcome to the freehttpd documentation!  This is the first page, which will guide
you through the installation of freehttpd.

* Requirements

To compile, install and run freehttpd, you need to ensure that you have the
following tools installed:

- A C compiler that supports GNU extensions (e.g. [[https://gcc.gnu.org][GCC]] or [[https://clang.llvm.org][Clang]])
- [[https://openssl.org][OpenSSL]] - For TLS encryption

Additionally, you might also need to install the following:

- [[https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/libsystemd.html][libsystemd]] - For systemd support
- GNU Autotools (e.g. [[https://gnu.org/software/automake][Automake]] and [[https://gnu.org/software/autoconf][Autoconf]])

* Building from source

1. First of all, you will have to get the source distributions or clone the
   Git repository.  If you have downloaded the source tarballs already, run the
   following:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     tar -xvf freehttpd-x.y.z.tar.gz # x.y.z is the version
     cd freehttpd-x.y.z/
   #+END_SRC

   If you want to clone the Git repository instead, run the following command
   (assuming you have Git installed):

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     git clone https://github.com/onesoft-sudo/freehttpd.git
     cd freehttpd/
   #+END_SRC

   However, cloning it will land you to the latest *unstable* code.  Use it at
   your own risk as things may break.

2. After you obtain the source code, you can go ahead and build it.  Since
   freehttpd uses GNU Autotools, you can run the usual commands:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     ./configure           # Add `--help' to see more details
     make -n$(nproc)       # Run the build
   #+END_SRC

   If you *cloned the repository* however, you should run the following *first*:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     ./bootstrap
   #+END_SRC

3. After that, you can run the installation, if the build succeeds:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     make install
   #+END_SRC

   In most modern systems, you will need superuser permissions to install things
   in standard directories like ~/usr/~ and ~/usr/local/~.  For this reason, you
   will need to run the install command as superuser to perform the installation
   unless you have changed the installation destination.

   Run one of the following commands, whichever works for you:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     sudo make install          # Traditional sudo
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     doas make install          # Another tool, doas
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     run0 make install          # systemd-run
   #+END_SRC

   If none of the above commands seem to work (e.g. because you don't have the
   programs like ~sudo~ installed), you will have to manually login as superuser:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     su -
     make install
   #+END_SRC

   If everything was right, you should now have freehttpd installed on your
   system.  Congratulations!

4. For more details, please see the [[../INSTALL][INSTALL]] file in the project root.  Also
   consider running =./configure --help= to see the available configuration
   options.

* Configuration

Configuring freehttpd is straightforward.  You can simply edit the configuration files
located in your ~$(sysconfdir)~, which is typically ~/etc/~.  The main configuration file
is usually ~$(sysconfdir)/freehttpd/fhttpd.conf~ unless configured otherwise during build.

Here is a simple configuration that creates a virtual host to serve ~/var/www/html~:

#+begin_src conf
  host ("localhost:80") {
    # Makes this vhost default
    is_default = true;

    # Document root to serve
    docroot = "/var/www/html";
  }
#+end_src
